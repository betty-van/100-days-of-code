  - completed Plurality in Pset3 (super hard, took a long time to figure out)
  - started Runoff 
  - understanding different sorting algorithms and big O
  - completed Project Euler 1: multiples of 3 or 5 under 1000 using simple iterative math and summations for faster

## Day 5: 10-25-19
  - Learned about trees
  - Working on Runoff
  - Completed all of Runoff except problems with tabulate function on 2nd iteration after first elimination round asking for assistance

## Day 6: 10-26-19
  - Finished Runoff and submitted
  - Starting Pset 4
  - Finished up to reflect of Filter, understanding pointers and malloc took all day on and off

  - LeetCode weekly contest tonight at 7: 30pm, tried two problems, no success

## Day 7: 10-27-19
  - Finished Filter with some rounding errors, but does what it's supposed to do
  - Starting  Recover
  - Finished watching Lecture 5 - data structures
  - Started creating my portfolio website (not much yet)
