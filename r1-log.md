-Developed a plan for the next few months  
-Completed several LeetCode and CodeWars problems   
  -Defang an IP address  
  -Reverse a string  
  -area of a square that has arc of length A  
  -fibonacci recursively  
-Learned the following in JS course:  
  -object.create  
  -constructors  
  -first class functions  
-Random knowledge gained: maps  


## Day 2: 10-22-19  
-Enrolled in CS50 Intro to CS 2019 course  
-Started logging on 100 days of code  
-Completed Leture 0  
-Started Lecture 1  
-HackerRank recursion for factorial (can do this in like a minute now)  
-LeetCode: balanced strings  
-Finished Lecture 1  
-Started problem set 1  
-Completed Mario/less and wrote most of Cash
-focusing on CS50 until complete, then back to JS

## Day 3: 10-23-19
  -finished Cash and submitted  
  -Started watching Lecture 2 
  -completed a HackerRank problem for converting decimal -> binary and printing the highest number of consecutive ones, took 1.5 hours to learn parseInt(input, 2) and Math.max(...input) and debugging
  -finished watching Lecture 2
  -started Readability in problem set 2
  
## Day 4: 10-24-19
  - completed debugging Readability and ensuring correctness
  - completed Caesar in approximately 3 hours with debugging and checking correctness
  - finished Problem Set 2
  - started Lecture 3 & finished Lecture 3
  - started Pset 3
  - completed Plurality in Pset3 (super hard, took a long time to figure out)
  - started Runoff 
  - understanding different sorting algorithms and big O
  - completed Project Euler 1: multiples of 3 or 5 under 1000 using simple iterative math and summations for faster

## Day 5: 10-25-19
  - Learned about trees
  - Working on Runoff
  - Completed all of Runoff except problems with tabulate function on 2nd iteration after first elimination round asking for assistance
  - Completed Lecture 4 (pointers, hexadecimal, addresses, char*, &) 

## Day 6: 10-26-19
  - Finished Runoff and submitted
  - Starting Pset 4
  - Finished up to blur of Filter, understanding pointers and malloc took all day on and off
  - LeetCode weekly contest tonight at 7: 30pm
